# Advanced Text Functions

Advanced Text Functions is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides more advanced text manipulation functions that are included by default.

## Features

Instead of having to install a separate extension for *every minor text feature*, the aim of this project is to include common text functions in one extension.

- Unique Lines (Remove duplicate lines)
- Shuffle Lines
- Join Lines
- Split Lines

## Requests
I'm happy to accept enhancements ideas (better yet pull requests) for new features, however the aim of this project is to include general purpose text functions. **If the feature is specific to a format, language, or framework it probably belongs in it's own extension.**

## Examples
### Unique Lines
From
```
a
b
b
a
```
To
```

### Shuffle Lines
From
```
a
b
b
a
```
To (different every time!)
```
b
a
b
a
```

### Join Lines
From
```

b
c

```

### Split Lines
From
```

```
